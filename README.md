# 🌍 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## 📌 Project Overview

This Jupyter Notebook project analyzes global COVID-19 data by tracking trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccinations. It uses data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus), with a focus on three countries: **Kenya**, **India**, and the **United States**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Load and clean real-world COVID-19 data
- Analyze total and daily case trends
- Compare vaccination progress across countries
- Calculate and visualize COVID-19 death rates
- Provide insights into global pandemic dynamics

## 🔬 Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**  
  Filters relevant countries, parses dates, and handles missing values

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
  - Total cases and deaths over time  
  - Daily new case comparisons  
  - Vaccination trends  
  - Death rate calculations

- **Data Visualization**  
  Uses **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to generate clear, comparative charts

- **Insights & Observations**  
  Highlights how different countries have been affected by the pandemic

## 📊 Tools Used

- `Pandas` – Data manipulation  
- `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` – Visualization  
- *(Optional)* `Plotly` – Interactive visualizations (expandable)

## 📈 Key Insights

- The **United States** reported the highest case and vaccination counts.
- **India** experienced pronounced spikes corresponding to major COVID-19 waves.
- **Kenya** showed lower totals but also had limited vaccination coverage.
- **Death rates** declined over time, likely due to widespread vaccination efforts.

## 🚀 Possible Extensions

- Add interactive choropleth maps using `Plotly`
- Build a dashboard with `Streamlit` or `Dash`
- Integrate real-time data updates via APIs

## 📁 Getting Started

1. Download the dataset: [OWID COVID-19 Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data)
2. Save it as `owid-covid-data.csv` in your working directory.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:  

jupyter notebook COVID19_Global_Data_Tracker.ipynb
